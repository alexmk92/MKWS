# MKWS - iOS Application

The code in this project has been written for my final year project at Plymouth University, and the repo shall act as a project management tool, so I can reference my progress through each SPRINT.

I have built the application for iOS8 in XCode6, using features such as size classes to deliver a great performance on all devices, I've also utilised methods such as concurrency and have written my own API which can be found here.  If you have any questions about this project please get in contact with me at alexander.sims92@gmail.com.

The code for this project may be used for educational purposes only, but please do not try to claim it as your own.
